## Features

This is a simple Twitter bot and will retweet, favorite/like and REPLY randomly on the basis of hashtags as a query that we will use.

## Requirements

* You must have <a href="https://nodejs.org" target="_blank">Node.js</a> installed on your system.
* A Twitter Account.
* Your bot will be using <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/twit" target="_blank">twit</a> which is an npm module to manipulate tweets and streams, and to communicate with the <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs" target="_blank">Twitter API</a>.
* A <a href="https://www.heroku.com/" target="_blank">Heroku</a> free account to deploy your bot.
* Download git from https://git-scm.com/downloads and install it on you computer.

## Deploy on heroku

* Signup for a free account by filling a form on https://heroku.com .

* After a successful signup, you will be redirected to dashboard.

* Create a new app by clicking the New button at the top right.

* Fill in your app name (it should be in lower case) and choose your relevant region.

* Move to the directory where you have saved the bot source file using CLI.

* Download Heroku CLI. Refer the document here on how:

https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/command-line

Install it by using Teminal on Mac or Windows Powershell:

$heroku

* Login through CLI:

$heroku login

Give the credentials. You will be logged in.

* Choose your **Deployment method** on the dashboard, it could be Heroku Git, GitHub or Dropbox. But I highly recommend to go with Heroku Git.

* Follow the cammands given under deployment methods to turn your directory into a git repository and to deploy on heroku.

* Make sure the app is worker app not a web app. Procfile is necessary for that.
